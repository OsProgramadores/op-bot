# Running the bot as a docker container

Assuming you already have `docker` (and `docker-compose`) installed and running, a few other
things are needed in order to run the bot as a docker container:

1. Create the docker image to run the bot:
```
make
```

This should create the image `op-docker/op-bot`. You should see something like the following, as the last lines of the process, indicating things went well:

```
Successfully built 3848aa863492
Successfully tagged op-docker/op-bot:latest
```


2. Place the file `.op-bot.json` inside folder `bot-token-here`.

This file should have the following structure:

```
{
    "BotToken": "<TOKEN HERE>"
}
```
There are additional settings that go in this file, but `BotToken` is the bare minimum required in order to run the bot.


3. Inside the `/config` folder of the project, create the file `messages.json`, which could be a simple copy of `messages.json.sample` (found at the same directory), at this point.


4. Proceed to create the container:
```
docker-compose up
```

If things go well, you should see something along these lines:
```
Creating network "docker_default" with the default driver
Creating docker_bot_1 ...
Creating docker_bot_1 ... done
Attaching to docker_bot_1
bot_1  | 2017/07/22 20:18:19 Authorized on account osprogramadores_bot
```

In case of problems, read the error messages carefully, as they usually explain what went wrong. Also make sure you did the previous steps correctly.

And that's it.
